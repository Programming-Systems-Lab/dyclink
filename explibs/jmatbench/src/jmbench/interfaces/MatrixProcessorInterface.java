 * Inside of each iteration there should be no caching of past results.  Only numerically stable
 * solvers should be used.  The same operations used here will be used in the stability benchmark.

 * Upon exit the input and output matrices are (optionally) checked.  If the output matrices deviate
 * too much from the expected value/properties then a fault is recorded.  If input matrices have been
 * modified then a fault is recorded.

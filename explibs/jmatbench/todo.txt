- Add support for commercial libraries
 * Make it so everything will compile even if the library is not present.

- applet for displaying results

- Randomly draw operation and matrix size
 * first do a run through until an exception occurs
 * once max matrix size is known randomly draw
 * only save each trial results in XML
 * terminating conditions. 1) number of trials per op. 2) total computational time per op.

- only plot results if errors don't exist
- use BigDecimal to compute accuracy of libraries
- stability of BigDecimal matrices?

- convert results to excel format

- Create a memory leak test
